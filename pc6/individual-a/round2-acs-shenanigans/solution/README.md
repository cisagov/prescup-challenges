# ACS Shenanigans

This guide will provide challengers with full insight into how this challenge is solved. 

## Overview

Your goal is to analyze log files for signs of sensitive data exfiltration, monitor network traffic for active breaches, and develop a script to simulate Access Control System(ACS) scan replays.

### Part 1

**Task**: Players will analyze a raw log file using the provided spec (`Spec.md`).

**Question**: What is the value of the intercepted frame sent at 2024-12-13 09:11:00?

### Solution - Token 1

Here are the steps needed to complete question 1:

1. First, navigate to `https://challenge.us/files` and download two files:
* `fac_187.log` - This log file contains packets using the ACS protocol who's specifications is present in the `Spec.md` file coupled with it in this directory.
* `Spec.md` - (Important) This file contains the encryption algorithms' general characteristics and will be used throughout the duration of the challenge.
2. Copy these files to your working directory `cp ~/Downloads/* .`

ðŸ’¡**Think of the Spec.md file as a user manual for a product - it details the appropriate steps needed in order to use it properly.**

**File Listing**

In order for us to understand the data presented in the log, we must follow the specification in order to create a way to decode the log. The `Spec` file provides several insights into the protocol:
* XOR'ing occurs within the file
* Hex content must be decoded
* The protocol in use is `structured` and uniform in nature (making it more predicable from a reverse engineering perspective)

With all of these factors in mind, let's develop a script to automate decoding of this log file:

```python
# filename: decrypt.py
# usage: python3 decrypt.py
def xor_decrypt(data, key):
    return bytes([byte ^ key for byte in data])

def decode_hex_dump(hex_dump_file, output_file, key):
    with open(hex_dump_file, 'r') as infile, open(output_file, 'wb') as outfile:
        for line in infile:
            hex_part = line[10:57].strip()  # Extract the hex part
            hex_bytes = bytes.fromhex(hex_part)
            decrypted_bytes = xor_decrypt(hex_bytes, key)
            outfile.write(decrypted_bytes)

# Example usage
hex_dump_filename = 'fac_187.log'
decoded_output_filename = 'decoded_log.txt'
xor_key = 0xAA  # XOR key for decryption

# Decode the hex dump log file
decode_hex_dump(hex_dump_filename, decoded_output_filename, xor_key)

print(f"Decoded data saved to {decoded_output_filename}")
```

The script does the following with each line of content from the log:
* The `xor_decrypt()` function applies an XOR operation to each byte in a given data set using a single-byte key, effectively decrypting or obfuscating the data.
* The `decode_hex_dump()` function reads a hex dump file line by line, extracting the relevant hexadecimal portion (from positions 10 to 57) while ignoring other content such as addresses or ASCII representations.
* The extracted hex values are then converted into bytes, then decrypted using the XOR function with a predefined key (0xAA).
* The decrypted byte stream is written into an output file (decoded_log.txt), effectively reconstructing the original data before obfuscation.

After execution of the script `python3 decrypt.py`, you will presented with the output below. We can now see that line `26` harbors the answer we seek:

Examine the output file "decoded_log.txt" `cat decoded_log.txt`

![Decoded ASCII preview showing decrypted log contents](images/c25.01.03.png "Decoded log ASCII preview") 

**Answer**: The answer to question 1 is `01011101100001011100100101`.

## Part 2 

**Task 2**: Players run PCAP to gather scans. 

### Solution - Token 2

**Question 2**: How many unique card numbers were detected in the intercepted transmissions?

The simplest way to solve this question is to use native commands presented by the Linux environment and create a filter by which we can extract the desired result.

In this case, using the `awk` command allows users to parse organized data and specify which fields should be examined in a query.  We will examine our file "decoded_log.txt" from Part 1. 

In this case, we have several options:

`awk '{print $1}' decoded_log.txt | sort | uniq`

We can use `cut` to perform the same operation:

`cat decoded_log.txt | cut -d" " -f1 | sort | uniq -c`

In both instances, the result is is two lines from the log returned to the terminal:

![Terminal screenshot showing unique card numbers detected](images/c25.02.01.png "Unique card numbers detected")

**Answer**: As a result, the answer to this question is `2`

### Solution - Token 3

**Question 3**: How many events were logged each day?

Using native tools in our Kali instance, we can either `visually` inspect the decoded log ("decoded_log.txt") to determine how many events per day or we can use the tool `grep` to pull out a specific date and see the accompanying data.

Using a command (as seen below) can aid in this effort:

`grep 2024-12-11 decoded_log.txt | wc -l`

Alternatively, we can use this command: 

`cat decoded_log.txt | grep "2024-12-14" | wc -l`

In both instances, we're calling `grep` to filter the text to only present lines that contain the specified date (`2024-12-14` in this instance) and then we pass it to the `wc` or `word count` utility to list (-l) the lines that match what we're looking for:

![Terminal output showing event count for date 2024-12-14](images/c25.03.01.png "Event count for 2024-12-14")

**Answer**: After executing either of these commands, the result should be `8` (8 lines presented back to the user regardless of the date filtered against).

### Solution - Token 4

**Question 4**: What is the interval(in seconds) between each Wiegand broadcast?

Using the protocol analyzer `Wireshark`, players can identify the traffic they will need to answer this question.

* Open Wireshark from the Applications menu or by typing `wireshark &` in your command line.
* Double-click `eth0` to select the interface to monitor.

![Wireshark interface selection window showing eth0](images/c25.04.01.png "Wireshark interface selection")

After opening the Wireshark, navigate to the Filter bar above the packet content and enter `udp` or, more specifically `udp.port = 8080`.  

![Wireshark filter bar with udp.port = 8080](images/c25.04.02.png "Wireshark UDP port filter")

When looking at the left most value in the results from the `Time` column (displayed in seconds, by default) and visually looking for communications with the broadcast address (`10.5.5.255`), you will find that the interval is `30 seconds`:
* 138.xxxx
* 168.xxxxx
* 198.xxxxx

**Answer:** The answer in this instance is `30`.

### Solution - Token 5

**Question 5**: How many unique Wiegand broadcasts were detected in the captured traffic?

`Broadcasts` are network communications where one asset is asking the location of another (traditionally seen in ARPs) or generally used for communications to all assets in a network. 

Using the packet capture from Part 4, filter as above using `udp.port == 8080`. Using this filtered list of packets, export to a file: File -> Export Specified Packets.  Ensure you have selected "All Packets" and "Displayed" as indicated here. Save file as "broadcast.pcapng" 

![Screenshot of Wireshark Export Specified Packets dialog](images/c25.05.01.png "Export Specified Packets in Wireshark")

Now that we have this filtered packet capture "broadcast.pcapng", we can use the tshark command and apply techniques from earlier to get a count of the unique data fields: `tshark -r broadcast.pcapng -T fields -e data | sort | uniq`

![Terminal screenshot showing unique Wiegand broadcast values](images/c25.05.02.png "Unique Wiegand broadcast values")

**Answer**: We can see 4 unique values; as a result, the answer to this question is `4`.

### Solution - Token 6

**Question 6**: What is the value of the broadcast's facility code?

Examining `Spec.md` there is mention of characters 2-9 in communication being viewed as the `facility code` of any given packet.

When examining a sample packet, we see the following binary value `10111011` in those positions which, when converted, becomes `187`.

![Packet detail view highlighting binary facility code bits](images/c25.06.01.png "Facility code binary segment")

You can perform this conversion using an online calculator (binary to decimal conversion) or by running the following from your command line: `echo "ibase=2; 10111011" | bc`

![Terminal conversion of binary 10111011 to decimal 187](images/c25.06.02.png "Binary to decimal conversion for facility code")

**Answer**: As a result, the answer is `187`.

## Part 3

### Solution - Token 7 

**Question 7**:  Which door is unlocked?

In our previous packet analysis, we see that IP address `10.5.5.87` is **consistently communicated with**. Additionally, in the challenge instructions, we are told that the scan data to open doors is `01011101100000101001110011` 

![Wireshark timeline showing consistent communication to IP 10.5.5.87](images/c25.07.01.png "Consistent communication timeline")

Finally, in our spec file ("Spec.md"), we find that the default listening port for this service is UDP/8081. 

![Packet analysis showing the service spec](images/c25.07.02.png "Spec details")

In order to pass data across the network to the controller, we can use a tool called `netcat` or `nc`. Netcat is a power tool that has the ability to open network sockets and write data to the socket for transfer to remote assets.

Let's now combine the information we know with `nc` to send it to the controller:

`echo -n "01011101100000101001110011" | nc -u -w1 10.5.5.87 8081`

The result of this is:

![Controller response indicating door unlocked](images/c25.07.03.png "Controller Response")

The controller will present the user (if correct) with the appropriate response (cardinal direction of door opened).

**Answer**: The answer to this final question will be either `North`, `South`, `East` or `West` depending on the version of the challenge you execute.

**This concludes the Solution Guide for this challenge.**
