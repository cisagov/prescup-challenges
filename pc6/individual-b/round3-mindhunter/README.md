# Mindhunter

‚öîÔ∏è **After deploying the challenge, please wait five minutes for before starting to allow the systems to set up correctly.**

ü™û It's all about perspective. Challengers are tasked with finding and traversing their mind to deal with problems that manifested themselves into a set of systems riddled with complex web vulnerabilities that have one thing in common. Everything is not as it seems. 

**NICE Work Roles**
* Vulnerability Analysis
* Exploitation Analysis

**NICE Tasks**
* [T0280](https://niccs.cisa.gov/workforce-development/nice-framework/): Identify and validate vulnerabilities in the system	
* [T0653](https://niccs.cisa.gov/workforce-development/nice-framework/): Identify and recommend methods for exploiting target systems	
* [T0269](https://niccs.cisa.gov/workforce-development/nice-framework/): Conduct exploitation of targets using identified vulnerabilities	
* [T0650](https://niccs.cisa.gov/workforce-development/nice-framework/): Conduct target and technical analysis of systems and vulnerabilities	

## Background
Challengers are tasked with navigating complex web applications which each have latent vulnerabilities. You must:
* Use situational awareness to find `your mind`
* Look through each of the four components of existence to re-gain power over your mind, body, soul, and center (peace) 
* Detect any neural (web application) vulnerabilities 
* Conduct exploit development operations to exploit discovered vulnerabilities
* Retrieve all tokens and free your mind from the system

This challenge is about self reflection, enumeration, and accomplishment. Your achievements are your lifeline.

## Getting Started
Launch into the `parallax` VM machine at the bottom of this brief to get started..

Next, you will be prompted to log into the machine. Please enter `mindhunter` for the username and `mirrors` for the password.

**Enumeration is key to success within this challenge**. Use appropriate headers where needed (Content-Type, etc.).

## Submission

**IMPORTANT**
Discovered tokens may harbor this format: "ü™ô token: <TOKEN>". The token to be submitted for scoring is <TOKEN>.

## Note
Attacking or unauthorized access to `challenge.us` (10.5.5.5) is forbidden. You may only use the provided web page to view challenge progress and download any challenge artifacts that are provided.

Attempting to circumvent portions of this challenge will *increase* the difficulty and potentially lock you out of being issued certain tokens. Be careful of the types of attacks used and their timing - as views change, so do the defenses in your `mind`.
