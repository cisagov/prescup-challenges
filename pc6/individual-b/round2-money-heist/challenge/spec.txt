- `magic` (4 bytes): A 4-byte sequence that identifies the packet as a valid packet. A valid packet should be identified by the sequence `0x3fa95c1d`.
- `sequence number` (uint32): A sequence number that identifies the order of the packet in the stream.
- `timestamp` (uint64): A timestamp that indicates the time at which the packet was sent.
- `type` (uint8): A type number that identifies the type of the packet.

- `payload` (bytes): The payload data of the packet.

The payload for each packet type is as follows:
