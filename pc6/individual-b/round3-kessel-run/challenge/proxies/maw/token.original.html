<h1>Maw Hack Back</h1>
<p>You wipe the sweat from your brow. The canary alarm goes off as you draw dangerously close to the malicious force of the Black Hat Holes. The HTTP drive groans as its buffers strain past their limit... </p>

<p>Success! The HTTP drive begins to settle as the pull of the Black Hat Holes grows weaker behind you, and you pass through the proxy point shaken, but with your "Connection" still "keep-alive".</p>

<p>Looking at your canary monitor, you see the malicious force of the Black Hat Holes overwrote it with the Maw token: TOKEN</p>

<p>Thank goodness that didn't get wedged in your return address!!! Now just a small jump past an Imperial firewall to reach Kessel...</p>
