**NICE Tasks**
- [T1351](https://niccs.cisa.gov/workforce-development/nice-framework/work-role/defensive-cybersecurity): Determine impact of malicious activity on systems and information
- [T1370](https://niccs.cisa.gov/workforce-development/nice-framework/work-role/incident-response): Collect intrusion artifacts
- [T1347](https://niccs.cisa.gov/workforce-development/nice-framework/work-role/defensive-cybersecurity): Detect cybersecurity attacks and intrusions

## Background

Anomalous behavior has been detected on some of the organization’s workstations. As members of the incident response team, your objective is to identify, analyze, and contain the threat before it spreads further, gaining insight into the adversary’s tools and techniques along the way.

## Getting Started

Download the file ``Adversary_TTP.xls`` located on `challenge.us`. 

Two user machines, ``green_host`` and ``blue_host`` are exhibiting strange behavior. Both are simultaneously accessible from the ``Kali-Workstation``.
- Question 1: You will need to remediate the ``green_host``. You can run the ``Grading Check`` from ``challenge.us`` for a list of required tasks!
- Question 2: The attacker is using a strange wrapper on a familiar executable. For this token, you need to run the executable and supply the ``--token`` argument. Surely it will cooperate! 
- Question 3: Let's see where this came from! Access and profile the foreign infrastructure. You will need to use the ``Adversary_TTP.xls`` file available on ``challenge.us``.
