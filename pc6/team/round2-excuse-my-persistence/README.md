## Background

Equipped with a network topology diagram and a target, your team is tasked with moving through an adversary’s layered network. Each stage reveals critical information, credentials, and paths leading toward the main objective: discovering secrets.

## Getting Started

Our current intelligence provides only a limited understanding of the target environment. Make use of the network diagram on `challenge.us`.
