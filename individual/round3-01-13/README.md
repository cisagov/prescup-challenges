# 13


## Background
You've been assigned to what Agent Mills has given up on: 13 encoded or encrypted files taken from a confiscated laptop. In a spot of good luck, he's left you his (albeit limited) notes and record of his progress.

## Getting Started

Can you decrypt the message of the 13 files?

In the file collection, look at `notes.txt` for Agent Mills' progress before you get started.

The flag is a string containing geographic coordinates in degrees, minutes, seconds (example: `43°2’27”N 77°14’30”W`)
