# A Marvelous Challenge in Uncovering Secrets

#### Category: Collect and Operate
#### Difficulty Level: 250
#### Executive Order Category: Cyber Analysis

## Background
Intelligence sources have recovered a set of data files that they believe contain a 26 character hidden message.

## Getting Started
The binary file provided is believed to only run in Linux/Unix environments. You might try tools like Strings or a Hex
Editor to view the challenge files in more detail.
1. Compare the original image to the embedded image to find the encoded message
2. Analyze the binary to determine what it requires to run (i.e. file names and/or names)
3. Create a set of required files and run the binary against your own 26 character message
4. Reverse the encoding process by analyzing the newly embedded image file and your original message
5. Apply this reverse process to the embedded image to determine the hidden message
Be sure not to overwrite the embedded image file by making extra copies of the original for testing.
