# Little Compromise

#### Category: Analyze and Investigate
#### Difficulty Level: 250
#### Executive Order Category: Big Data Analysis

## Background

The IT team at XYZ bank believes they have a data compromise. The suspected activity took place some time ago, so they
have only limited access to archived data. This includes web proxy logs, firewall logs, and an export of their syslog
collection from the time question. Not all of their hosts were forwarding events to syslog, but several key servers
within their architecture were sending their Windows Security Events.

two challenges were very similar and primarily differed in the questions asked and the specific datasets used.
