## Background
The network administrator keeps a "fun" little game running for anyone to kill time when work is slow. Anyone is free to try it if they have time, and progress is shared. The game is a small trading game and the goal is to amass enough wealth to buy the retirement package (i.e., the challenge flag). So far, no one has been able to make it far enough to generate the obscene amount of money required. However, you've just managed to get access to the server code...

## Getting Started
You will need to have the `./required/server` executable running on your local system. It's a Linux ELF64 binary file. You should also create a `flag.txt` file in the same directory as the server program. The content of this file does not actally matter - it only contained the flag during the competition.

Competitors were given the `./challenge/gameclient.py` and `./challenge/server.rs` files to solve this challenge.
