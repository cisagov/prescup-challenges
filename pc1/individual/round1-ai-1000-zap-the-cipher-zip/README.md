# Zap the Cipher Zip
#### Category: Analyze and Investigate
#### Difficulty Level: 1000
#### Executive Order Category: Cyber Analysis

## Getting Started

For this challenge, you will need some password-cracking tools. It's recommended to have a Kali Linux VM available.

Your task is to analyze a set of files from an employee's hard drive to see if the files contain classified documents.

These documents have been encrypted and obfuscated by the employee using various techniques.

You will find these documents in the `challenge` directory.

The document package was zipped and encrypted along with some notes about the employee, but unfortunately the key to
decrypt was not written down correctly by the junior examiner.

You will need to figure out the correct key to open the zip file before proceeding with your investigation.
