You have been tasked to analyze and investigate the files on the iso. The purpose of this challenge is to find if the owner of these files was exfiltrating/storing classified documents. There appears to be a lot of zips, encryption, and other confusing tactics. Please begin by trying to use the key to decrypt the first .gpg file.

Good luck!
