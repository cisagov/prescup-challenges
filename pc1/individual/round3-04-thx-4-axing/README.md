#### Executive Order Category: Software Exploitation

## Background
You are given an image (`CHALLENGE.JPEG`) on the desktop of an Ubuntu VM.
You must extract additional files and search for a vulnerable executable
named `vuln`. Once you find it, you must craft an exploit for the program
that will reveal the flag.

In order for the vulnerable file to read the flag, it must be exploited
outside a debugger.

## Getting Started
**Please Note:** This challenge has been modified from its original form to
work in your local (Linux) environment. The original exercise relied on the
user **not** having `sudo -s` root-shell acess to the challenge VM. In this
modified version, figuring out the *location* of the flag is offered as a
partial subset of the original challenge.

The flag is in the form of GPS coordinates (e.g., `##°##′##′′N ##°##′##′′W`).
