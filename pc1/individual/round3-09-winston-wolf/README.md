## Background
You're trying to learn more about a new type of malware, but it won't continue
if it detects that it is running inside of a VM.

You must clean the VM of all references to virtualization so that the binary
will download the malware and thereby give you the flag.

## Getting Started
To begin, you need an existing Windows 10 virtual guest (e.g., on VMWare).

**Caution!** Before beginning the challenge, we strongly recommend taking a
snapshot of the VM in a working state, to serve as a restore point after
completing the challenge.

Once you have logged on to the Windows VM, unpack `WinstonWolf.zip` into your
`Downloads` folder, and follow the instructions in the resulting `README` file.

**Please Note:** This challenge has been modified from its original form to
work locally on your own Windows 10 VM.

The flag is in the form of GPS coordinates (e.g., `##°##′##′′N ##°##′##′′W`).
