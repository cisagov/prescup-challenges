# Slackin’


## Background
An operative captured a thumb drive which is believed to contain the coordinates of a critical infrastructure site that an adversary plans to attack. The thumb drive appears to have an executable which extracted the contents of a password protected zip file, but the program no longer runs.

Can you unlock the zip file and find the coordinates of the next target?

## Getting Started

You are provided with a disk image of the captured thumb drive. Analyze the image using any tools you feel are appropriate to find the flag. The flag contains geographic coordinates in degrees, minutes, and seconds ( for example: `43°2’27”N 77°14’30”W` ).

Submit the coordinates to capture the flag!
