#### Category: Collect and Operate
#### Difficulty Level: 500
#### Executive Order Category: Forensics

## Background
Aristagoras led the Ionian revolt against the Persian Empire in 499 BC. He timed the revolt with other Greek city states
via an early example of steganography. A compatriot sent a message by shaving a slave's head, tattooing the message,
waiting for the hair to grow back, and then sending the slave to deliver the message. When he made it to Miletus, he
shaved his head and successfully delivered the message.
