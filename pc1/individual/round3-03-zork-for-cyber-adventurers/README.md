# Zork for Cyber Adventurers

## Background
In this challenge, you will play a text-based adventure game. Along the way, you must solve small problems requiring various skills in order to advance. Be prepared for dead-ends, backtracking, deaths, and hopefully to find the flag in the end.

## Getting Started

The challenge data set (`Challenge.zip`) includes a PDF file (`Problem List.pdf`) listing the details and instructions for each problem. The problems are clearly numbered, and you will be told which problem to consult when required.

To start the game, execute `java -jar Adventure.jar`. You'll need JDK installed on your system. (For Windows system, make sure the environment variable `Path` is set to JDK installation folder housing the `jar` executable)

**Do not alter the game jar file or else you risk the game not functioning correctly.**

Once the game is running, do not exit the running program, or else your state will be lost, and you will have to enter all answers again. Successful responses will be saved, and you will not have to enter them multiple times as long as you do not quit the game or close the terminal. When you do eventually find the flag, the terminal window will stay open until you choose to exit.

As you play the game, you can use the following keypresses at any time:
* Type `b` or `B` and then press [Enter] to go back one room
* Type `x` or `X` and then press [Enter] to return to the castle entrance

The flag is in the form of GPS coordinates.
