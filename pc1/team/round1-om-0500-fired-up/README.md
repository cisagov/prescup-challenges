# Fire'd Up

#### Category: Operate and Maintain
#### Difficulty Level: 500
#### Executive Order Category: Cyber Defense

## Background
Large amounts of bandwidth have been noticed recently on your network. Unfortunately, you do not have a proxy or
firewalls in place to help block such traffic and several types of traffic are against the acceptable use policy.
Unauthorized traffic includes file transfers between clients over FTP or WinSCP/SSH, as well as file downloads from the
Internet, regardless of type or source. Streaming video services such as Netflix or YouTube are also unauthorized. The
only exception to high bandwidth usage are approved training sites hosted by trusted government partners. Your client
network falls within the 10.9.8.0/24 range.

## Getting Started
You will be provided with 4 large packet capture files, each representing roughly 15 minutes of network activity at
various times. Based on the given organizational policy on acceptable use, eliminate all unacceptable traffic from the
overall traffic captures and determine the user/system that is using more than 10MB of bandwidth but is still within the
acceptable use parameters. You may use any of the tools at your disposal and should split the workload up amongst team
members in order to speed up the process. All IP addresses and resolved hosts are associated with real Internet
destinations and can be used to verify certain types of traffic.

## ⚠️ Large Files ⚠️
This challenge includes large files as a separate download. Please download
