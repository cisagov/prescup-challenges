# Buried in the Sands of Time


## Background
An adversary has developed a new form of steganography which can embed data into NTFS filesystem timestamps. An operative captured a thumb drive which is believed to contain the coordinates of an intended target. Along with the thumb drive, a sample of code was captured which appears to implement the timestamp steganography. It is therefore likely that the coordinates have been encoded in this manner.

## ⚠️ Large Files ⚠️
This challenge includes large files as a separate download. Please download
[this zip](https://presidentscup.cisa.gov/files/pc1/team-round3-06-largefiles.zip)
and extract in _this directory_ to get started.

## Getting Started

You are provided with a disk image of the captured thumb drive and a sample of the steganographic source code. Analyze the image using any tools you feel are appropriate to find the flag. The flag is a string containing geographic coordinates in degrees, minutes, seconds (example: `43°2’27”N 77°14’30”W`). Submit the coordinates to capture the flag!
