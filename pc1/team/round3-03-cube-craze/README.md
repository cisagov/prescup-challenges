# Cube Craze

## Background
This challenge consists of a cyber-based Rubik's Cube that must be solved. When each phase of the Cube is solved, smaller tasks containing parts of the final key are unlocked.

## ⚠️ Large Files ⚠️
This challenge includes large files as a separate download. Please download
[this zip](https://presidentscup.cisa.gov/files/pc1/team-round3-03-largefiles.zip)
and extract in _this directory_ to get started.

## Getting Started

To begin, execute the file `cube.jar` by using the command `java -jar cube.jar`. More information about what to do next will be provided once the command is executed. All parts of the key are explicitly stated throughout the challenge, and there are no false flags.

**Please Note:** This challenge has been modified to work locally on your machine as long as you have Java installed. Also, you may run the jar file from any directory, make sure that the SS.txt file is within the same directory.

The flag is in the form of GPS coordinates.
