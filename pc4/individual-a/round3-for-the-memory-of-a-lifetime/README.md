## Getting Started

We think someone working for the space pirates stole one of our trade routes from a workstation in the Merchant League.  We've made a live image of the memory in the running workstation and copied some of the registry hives. We need someone to examine it and find out what has been taken and by whom. 

Examine the evidence located in the `Evidence` folder ([separate download](https://presidentscup.cisa.gov/files/pc4/individuala-round3-for-the-memory-of-a-lifetime-largefiles.zip))and answer the questions.

## Challenge Questions

1. Which user was using the Chrome browser when the capture was made?
2. Which user visited the Wikipedia page for Methane?
3. How many USB storage devices have been connected to this machine?
4. What is the volume friendly name of the first USB storage device attached to the machine?
5. Which user had connected the first USB storage device?
