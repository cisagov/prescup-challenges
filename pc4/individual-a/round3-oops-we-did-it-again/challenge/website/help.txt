The ransomware decrypter has a few options.

Always run the decrypter in a separate directory from the files you want to encrypt or decrypt, and add your encryption/decryption code to a file called "pwd" in the same directory as the program.

Use the "-p /path/to/files" option to tell the program the target directory 

To encrypt, use the "-m encrypt" option.

To decrypt, use the "-m decrypt" option.

Depending on the method, the program will encrypt or decrypt everything within the target directory and create a new directory called "encrypted" or "decrypted" in the current directory with the resulting files.

To access help, use the "help" option.
