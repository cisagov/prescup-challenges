## Getting Started

Someone was caught stealing information off of The Dauntless and transmitting it to another party.  We have seized their mobile device and created an image of the data partition to examine.  The image, `andrew.dd`, is placed on the Security Terminal workstation's desktop.  Examine the partition to try to determine what was compromised and if there is anyone else we should suspect. Examine the disk image to answer the questions.  

The time zone for the device is EDT (UTC -0400).
