## IMPORTANT

This challenge does not have any downloadable artifacts. The full challenge can be completed on the hosted site.

## Getting Started

An alien malware has infected the remote merchant console **Eternia**, rendering it unusable.  The IP address for this terminal is `10.5.5.79`. However, we can't login with our credentials.  Gain access to the machine from the provided Kali terminal, remediate the malware, and remove all persistence mechanisms it uses.


## Challenge Questions

Grading checks look for five specific remediated conditions. They are:

- **Remediation 1:** remove attacker's access vector (you might use the same access vector to gain access to the machine, but it must be closed to prevent future attacks)
- **Remediation 2:** remove persistence mechanism A
- **Remediation 3:** remove persistence mechanism B
- **Remediation 4:** remove persistence mechanism C
- **Remediation 5:** remove persistence mechanism D

_Persistence mechanisms periodically recreate themselves. You must remove persistence in a way that prevents **all** mechanisms from coming back._
