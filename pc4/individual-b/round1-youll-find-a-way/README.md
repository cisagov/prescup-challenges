## Background

During the night shift, a crew member stumbled upon an unrecognized laptop left onboard. After further investigation, it was discovered that this laptop is connected to the _Dauntless_ network and was left behind by members of **XeNO**. In order to find out the owner/s of this laptop, find out the IP address, scan it for vulnerabilities and then find a way to get user and root access to this laptop by exploiting any found vulnerabilities.

## Getting Started

Your goal is to **remotely** discover the unknown laptop's IP address in the `10.5.5.0/24` network, scan this IP for vulnerabilities and then exploit said vulnerabilities to find this challenge's tokens. To do so, you will need to: 

1. Using your preferred method, scan the unknown laptop's IP address for vulnerabilities. 
2. Once you know if the laptop is vulnerable, find a way to exploit it and gain user access to find the first token on the user's Desktop. 
3. Search for any clues that might help you get root access on this laptop and find the next token on the root directory. 


## Challenge Questions

1. Provide the contents of `token1.txt`
2. Provide the contents of `token2.txt`
