# Final Goal

_Challenge Artifacts_

Competitors solve this challenge compiling an executable from a combination of the main program's source code while referencing the three DLL files. The source code and DLL files are split between 5 Codex Files (Codex A through Codex E). 

Each Codex is a zip file that competitors receive when they solve a challenge and submit a token string to prove they have solved a challenge.  

All 5 Codex Zip files an their corresponding tokens are provided in [this directory](./). 

The [complete archive](./complete-archive/) contains everything that the competitors must gather from the 5 Codex Zip files. 

The [source](./source/) directory contains the original source code for the executable that the competitors are tasked with building.
