## IMPORTANT

This challenge is only partially open sourced. The files in the [challenge directory](./challenge/) are provided to give a starting point if you want to recreate the challenge on your own. The full challenge can be completed on the hosted site.

## Background

The Aurellian Empire recently found some malicious scripts on one of its machines. These scripts could be creating users, opening ports, starting services, exfiltrating data, or connecting to remote services.  Your team must analyze the obfuscated scripts to discover what the scripts are doing. 

The Aurellians granted the team full permission to analyze and execute these scripts as necessary to acquire information on how they function and what systems they are communicating with.

## Getting Started

_Note: To play this challenge offline, please follow the instructions in the [challenge directory](./challenge/) before getting started._

There are five (5) ZIP files that each contain an obfuscated script.

## Challenge Questions

1. What is the token found by connecting to the service used by script1?
2. What is the token found by using script2?
3. What is the token found by connecting to the service used by script3?
4. What is the token found by connecting to the service used by script4?
5. What is the full path of the file that script5.py is attempting to exfiltrate?
