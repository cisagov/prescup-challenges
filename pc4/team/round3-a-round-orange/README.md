## Background

Orange smugglers have been peddling knock-off orange products containing lots of filler and dangerous substitutes. Intel tells us they use multiple web services to cover their tracks. We managed to infiltrate their `10.5.5.0/24` network and found out they have an `orange-glory` and a `space-guide` system containing an Orange Glory and a Space Travel website, respectively. 


## Getting Started

Gain access to the smugglers' systems on `10.5.5.0/24`, discover any other systems/networks the smugglers might be hiding, retrieve the list of employees who are part of the the smuggling ring, and shut down their Orange Glory website!

Use `https://challenge.us` to initiate grading for the final task. 


## Challenge Questions

1. What is the hostname of the system the smugglers are hiding on a subnet other than `10.5.5.0/24`?
2. One of the smugglers keeps a list of involved personnel on their desktop. What five employees are behind the illegal orange smuggling ring?
3. Shut down the Orange Glory website and retrieve your token at `https://challenge.us`.
