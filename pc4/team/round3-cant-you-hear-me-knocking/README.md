## Getting Started

We have recovered a transmission from an alien spy to a user on our systems.  This agent is known to hide messages in the audio track of streamed videos.  Extract the message from the **pcap** file, discover the hidden information, and act on it accordingly.

## Challenge Questions

1. What is the "from IP" given in the hidden message?
2. What is the text value in the token file at `C:\token\token\token1`.
