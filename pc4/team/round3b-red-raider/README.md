# Red Raider

## Background

An intergalactic buccaneer known as "The Red Raider" has been rumored to have a stockpile of ancient weapons and artifacts.

## Getting Started

After some searching, you and your team stumble upon a ship that appears to be commandeered by The Red Raider.  Rumor has it that they have a stockpile of ancient weapons and artifacts so, you try to negotiate with them. They donâ€™t speak english, so you will need to give them access to your language file.

- Ensure that the file \"english.dict\" is remotely accessible via anonymous SMB at smb://10.5.5.19:445

Your team was able to communicate with The Red Raider, but when you gave them access to your language file, you also gave them access to your network. They will begin attacking your ship to try and steal any artifacts we own. Might as well do the same!
