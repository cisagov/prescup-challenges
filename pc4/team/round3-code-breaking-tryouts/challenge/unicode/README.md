Potential trainee,

Use the provided character mapping, character set, and dictionary files to determine the key for decoding the provided Unicode encoded messsages. Frequecny is based on how many times a character appears in the dictionary file, where the most used character will be ranked first and the least used character(s) would be last. In the event where two characters have the same frequency, give the higher ranking to the character that comes first int he character set string - e.g. if "w" and "Q" have the same number of occurences, "w" should be ranked higher than "Q".

Use the full mapping key to translate the corrupted Unicode messages and recover the first passcode. Hint, it will be all lowercase.
