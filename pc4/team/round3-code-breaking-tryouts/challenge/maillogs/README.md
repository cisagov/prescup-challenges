Dear potential "trainee",

See if you can make sense of these mail logs and message files. I've hidden the second passcode in the messages, but make sure you assemble the password meant only for you - i.e. the one I sent - and in the order that I sent the pieces. My ID is based on the MD5 hash of my name.

You'll also need to know some trivia about your home planet, country, and solar system. I've been generous and given you one of the password pieces for free by not scrambling it.


Good luck,
Jupiter
