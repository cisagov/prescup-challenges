              This document establishes policies and procedures for the initial 
              contact between human beings and extraterrestrial lifeforms. </p>
            <p class="fst-italic">PURPOSE:
              The purpose of this policy is to establish guidelines for the initial contact 
              between humans and extraterrestrial lifeforms. This includes any species that may 
              have been previously encountered by humanity but which the crew is not aware of the encounter. </p>

                                <p class="subtext fst-italic mb-0">If a crew member becomes aware of an extraterrestrial lifeforms presence, 
                                  be it by direct observation or ancillary evidence that they may be present in the vicinity, they are to 
                                  immediately inform their on-duty superior officer.  Their superior officer will escalate with command 
                                  staff to ensure immediate notification to the ships captain.
                                  <br><br>
                                  In cases where a crew member is uncertain if what they have observed is a life-form, they are to immediately 
                                  inform their on-duty superior officer of their suspicion and degree of certainty. Department supervisors 
                                  and above will assess the report and determine if it is, in their opinion, a life form or not. If 
                                  determined to be a lifeform, the Captain is to be immediately notified by the department supervisor.

                                  The Captain will determine the appropriate contact policy based on the associated criteria and execute 
                                  the associated procedures:</p>

                               <strong>Policy:</strong> Do not make any attempt to communicate with extraterrestrial lifeforms. Avoid observation 
                               by alien lifeforms where such avoidance does not endanger crew or ship. Note location, disposition, and 
                               any additional information in the ships log, and include in the next daily communications report.

                            <strong>Policy:</strong> Communications will be established via RF where possible. If such communications cannot be established, 
                            priority will be given to meeting aliens within the Dauntless airlock, while wearing full EVA gear. Immediately 
                            subsequent to any interactions the airlock is to be vented, and any participating crew decontaminated. The content
                             of any communications will be limited to unclassified material, though at the captains discretion they may 
                             escalate only to FOUO material, and only where absolutely necessary. Note location, disposition, and any 
                             additional information in the ships log, and include in the next daily communications report.

                          <strong>Policy:</strong> Captain may jettison a first contact buoy if the buoy is no more than 6 months old, as the rendezvous 
                          information and RF contact information it contains may otherwise be out of date. If the captain has reason to 
                          believe that the buoy may somehow reveal the location of earth, they are expressly forbidden from deploying it. 
                          Regardless of the determination, the captain will immediately initiate a cube jump to a location at least one 
                          million kilometers from the point of contact, but not in the direction of earth. Note location, disposition, 
                          and any additional information in the ships log, and then immediately initiate communications 
                          with ARMOR Star Command.

                            Alien cultures at level III of the Kardashev scale. <br>
                            <strong>Policy:</strong> Captain will immediately notify ARMOR Star command and then attempt to initiate contact, regardless 
                            of alien disposition. If alien communication is successfully established, dialogue will focus on normalizing 
                            relations with Earth. If for any reason the captain believes that the aliens are hostile, they are to attempt 
                            to flee, but may not, under any circumstances, allow the ship or the location of earth to fall into the hands 
                            of the aliens. All measures are considered acceptable to avoid this outcome, including loss of ship and crew. 
                            The recommended avenues for self-destruction are, in order of priority:

                              <li>Navigation into the surface of an uninhabited rocky planet or dwarf planet</li>
                              <li>Activation of ship-board self-destruct systems</li>
