# Aurellian Galactic Museum

## Background

Home to objects and materials from across the galaxy, the Aurellian Galactic Museum contains several exhibits on the ancients. Access artifacts and see what your team can discover...

## IMPORTANT

This challenge does not have any downloadable artifacts. You may complete this challenge in the hosted environment.

## Getting Started

The Aurellians have a massive museum where they showcase many of the objects they’ve collected from the thousands of worlds they have conquered. The crew of the _Dauntless_ would love to get access to the archives but the snobbish Aurellian Elite caste members won’t give them permission to dock, as they consider the human’s spaceship to be a massive deathtrap as soon as they detect the nuclear reactor on-board. The only way space-OSHA regulations would even allow them near the precious museum is if they are reclassified as a garbage-scow hauling hazardous waste. As such, your team must meet a compliance checklist for such a vessel.

## Re-configure Your System

1. Access the attendant's computer system at 10.10.10.151/files.
2. Access the file [asha.txt](asha.txt) for detailed compliance requirements.
3. Click "Perform Compliance Scan" when you are ready to be scanned for compliance.

Once your team meets compliance, it obtains access to the museum.  

4. Access the Museum's SMB share (smb://10.10.10.57/MuseumGuests) and transfer the file codex_e.zip.
