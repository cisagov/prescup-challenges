## Background

We have located a colony of the Aurellian Empire on the planet Orionis Aa Alnitak III.

Intel states a cult of Seelax worshipers is located there. Even though the Seelax have been gone for a long time, this cult still covets any Seelax-related artifacts. This cult is riddled with illegal activity and misinformation. Several Seelax pieces have gone missing from the museum.

Your agency has access to some type of communication records for this colony on the planet Orionis Aa Alnitak III; however, requesting this communication is a bit tricky. Use this capability and other intel to answer these requests for information:

- Which aliens have probable interpersonal connections with one another?
- Which aliens worked together to steal the cult memorabilia?
- Which aliens collaborated to purchase the cult memorabilia?

## Getting Started

The associated intel documents (phone logs, satellite imagery, and persona non grata intel reports on individual aliens of this colony) are attached as an ISO on your Ubuntu and Windows intel workstations.

Find personal connections between two individual aliens using the intel reports (slides and imagery, *not* the phone logs) provided on the ISO. Once you find possible connections, use the CLAW. The CLAW is reachable at (`http://claw.us`) (10.5.5.18) from your Ubuntu and Windows intel workstations to request access to phone discussions between those two aliens. The phone discussions between these aliens appear to be one-way conversations.

Your CLAW request will only be granted/approved if suspicious data was discovered in the conversation ID record you requested.

**ALLOW FOR 15 SECONDS TO PASS AFTER SUBMITTING YOUR REQUEST. DO NOT REFRESH AND OVERWHELM YOUR SUPERIORS. BE PATIENT AND TRUST THE PROCESS.** 

This allows for a separation-of-duties process where you are not able to view all conversation records without reasonable justification. The CLAW chooses who will go and who will stay regarding these conversations, of course.

Intel also indicates these aliens utilize relatively common encoding and encryption to bypass local communication restrictions and filters. It's just enough obfuscation to bypass these technologies but still allow the recipient to be able to decode and decrypt the message. 

Find the connections between these aliens. Find their conversations (via the CLAW), decode/decrypt these conversations, and answer the four questions below.

## Challenge Questions

1. Two aliens are communicating regarding a secret operation to pull off the heist of Seelax artifacts. What is the Operation NAME? It is five characters long. Submit only these five characters.

2. What was the PIN for the door at the warehouse?

3. How much money did the buyers pay the thieves for the Seelax artifacts?

4. What was the three-digit house number of the location where the deal/transaction occurred?

## Notes

**Aliens who physically look alike is not an interpersonal connection. Get to know the aliens; however, start with the basics.**
