# Final Goal Program

## Background

As the Eden II base on Mars has been overrun with the hive-mind Harmony parasite, Dauntless has taken on the impossible. Your team must find the mysterious Seelax Artifact, an ancient tool used to cure Harmony infection, and save Eden II. All purchased intel is now available in the game's Mission Log, each possible lead to finding and decoding ancient galactic data files. With these codex, you just may be able to locate the Artifact...

To discover the coordinates of the final artifact and save Mars, players must first complete the final goal program. They accomplish this by
obtaining code and data files, then compiling and running an executable to generate the final coordinates.

The steps for accomplishing this task are highlighted below. 

1. Collect any three of the five alien codex files from around the galaxy by completing the other challenges. All 5 codexes are not required to recover the coordinates.  
2. Decode each codex to access ancient alien files - Decoded files will become available on the Codex Decoder machine.  
3. Reconstruct, compile and run the alien navigation program to obtain the coordinates.  
4. Enter the coordinates of the artifact into the ship's navigation system and initiate launch. 

## Getting Started

Competitors begin this challenge by collecting any three of the five alien codex files (A - E). After providing a correctly formatted codex file to the alien codex decoder they will receive the corresponding archive file (A - E).

In order to ensure that players can finish the game by solving any three challenges, the files are split up as follows:

Archive A: All 6 data files, no source code.  
Archive B: Library File #2, Library File #3, Main Source File, Data File 4, Data File 5, Data File 6.  
Archive C: Library File #1, Library File #3, Main Source file, Data File 2, Data File 3, Data File 6.  
Archive D: Library File #1, Library File #2, Main source file, Data File 1, Data file 3, Data File 5.  
Archive E: Library File 1, Library File 2, Library File 3, Data File 1, Data File 2, Data File 4.  

Start by looking at the main source file, Program.cs. This will instruct you as to what libraries and data files must be referenced, as well as how to compile and run the executable you produce. 

The final solution can be built using Visual Studio Code or from the C# command line tools on any of the five Kali Linux operator terminals. 

## Challenge Question

1. Provide the coordinates of the final artifact to save Mars.
