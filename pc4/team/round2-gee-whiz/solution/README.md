# Gee Whiz

_Solution Guide_

## Overview

In the rush to retrofit the *Dauntless* with CubeDrive technology, there was a slight oversight: the drive is capable of generating accelerations much in excess of what any human crew member could survive.

Your mission is to place a firewall rule in front of the drive controller's network interface, with the goal of preventing drive commands that request acceleration values in excess of specified human-survivable limits.

The document specifying the exact ordering of the fields in the data structure representing a drive command was also misplaced, but no worries, we can provide a binary program used to convert numeric values on the command line into the requisite hex string that can be sent to the drive controller over the network.

## Questions 1-5

_Gee Whiz_ is an infinity-style challengeâ€”a random solution is generated during challenge deployment. Notice that this solution guide is organized a little differently than other solution guides you may have read. This is because participants will complete these tasks prior to requesting all five submission tokens from http://challenge.us. Successfully completing _Gee Whiz_ and generating the five tokens entails:
- reverse-engineering a binary to gain understanding of its internal workings; 
- examining a sample source code firewall rule;
- modifying code for requests to ensure they pass the safety criteria; and
- compiling and executing a sample filter program

## Reverse-engineering the sample binary

Grab the binary from `http://challenge.us/files/drvctl.bin`. It would have been nice if you could simply run it and see which fields get modified by tinkering with the command line arguments. Alas, it's not an `x86_64` binary. Rather:

```
$ file drvctl.bin
drvctl.bin: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, UCB RISC-V, RVC, double-float ABI, ...
```

Your next move is to import it into Ghidra. After opening and analyzing the binary, you'll run across a function similar to this:

```
undefined8 FUN_00010730(float *param_1,float *param_2)
{
  float fVar1;
  float fVar2;
  float fVar3;
  float fVar4;
  undefined8 uVar5;
  float fVar6;
  
  fVar1 = *param_1;
  fVar2 = param_1[2];
  fVar3 = param_1[3];
  fVar4 = param_1[1];
  fVar6 = fVar1 * fVar1 + fVar2 * fVar2 + fVar3 * fVar3;
  sqrtf(SUB84(param_1,0));
  *param_2 = fVar6;
  if (fVar4 == 0.0) {
    uVar5 = 0;
  }
  else if ((fVar4 == 0.0) ||
          ((((ABS(fVar1) <= 6.0 && (ABS(fVar2) <= 6.0)) && (-1.5 <= fVar3)) &&
           ((fVar3 <= 3.0 && (*param_2 <= 8.0)))))) {
    if (((uint)fVar4 < 0x1d4c1) ||
       (((ABS(fVar1) <= 3.0 && (ABS(fVar2) <= 3.0)) &&
        ((-1.0 <= fVar3 && ((fVar3 <= 2.5 && (*param_2 <= 4.0)))))))) {
      if (((uint)fVar4 < 0x36ee81) ||
         ((((ABS(fVar1) <= 2.0 && (ABS(fVar2) <= 2.0)) && (-0.5 <= fVar3)) &&
          ((fVar3 <= 2.0 && (*param_2 <= 2.5)))))) {
        uVar5 = 0;
      }
      else {
        uVar5 = 0xffffffffffffffdf;
      }
    }
    else {
      uVar5 = 0xffffffffffffffdf;
    }
  }
  else {
    uVar5 = 0xffffffffffffffdf;
  }
  return uVar5;
}
```

The fact that `fVar1` through `fVar4` are placed consecutively in memory, starting at the address of `float *param_1`, leads you to assume they must be the fields `gx`, `gy`, `gz`, and (improperly typed as `float`) `ms`.

Furthermore, the comparisons `ABS(fVar[1,2]) <= 6.0` hint at `fVar1` and `fVar2` being either `gx` or `gy` (the two behave identically as far as imposed limits and are therefore interchangeable). The comparison to `-1.5` indicates that, in this particular variant of the challenge, the `gz` parameter is `fVar3`. This leaves `fvar4` to represent the `unsigned ms` field.

Going back to how `fVar[1..4]` are ordered in memory, it can be inferred that the internal ordering of `struct drv_ctl_t` is (in this variant):

```
struct drv_ctl_t {
        float gx;     /* fVar1 = *param_1 */
        unsigned ms;  /* fVar4 = param_1[1] */
        float gy;     /* fVar2 = param_1[2] */
        float gz;     /* fVar3 = param_1[3] */
};
```

An ascii request sent through the firewall to the drive computer would represent:

```
String: d3b07384d113edec49eaa6238ad5ff00
Legend: <------><------><------><------>
           gx      ms      gy      gz
```

## Writing a userspace firewall rule

Download the sample userspace firewall filter program from: `http://challenge.us/files/sample_filter.c`. This program already provides the necessary building blocks for writing a userspace firewall rule that works in conjunction with the `netfilter_queue` library. Inspecting the existing firewall rules on `svcnat`, you see:

```
$ sudo iptables-save
*filter
...
-A FORWARD -p tcp -m tcp --dport 31337 -j NFQUEUE --queue-num 0 --queue-bypass
...
*nat
...
-A PREROUTING -i ens32 -p tcp -m tcp --dport 31337 -j DNAT --to-destination 192.168.4.254:31337
...
```

Requests to port 31337 on the "public" interface of `svcnat` are forwarded over a private link to the actual server at `192.168.4.254`. Also, TCP traffic to port 31337 is queued for a userspace decision, to be made when a program such as `sample_filter` is in execution on `svcnat`.

You now have to modify the `tcp_payload_verdict()` function to return a value of `NF_DROP` when the 32-character request would exceed the specified acceleration and time limits, and `NF_ACCEPT` for requests passing the safety criteria. The new filter program might look something like what is provided. You will need to re-order the fields of `struct {...} ctl` according to what you found in Ghidra.

```

After recompiling `sample_filter` to reflect these changes:

```
gcc -o drvctl_filter sample_filter.c -Wall -lnetfilter_queue -lm
```

... copy it over to `svcnat` (e.g., using `scp`), and run it there as root:

```
$ sudo drvctl_filter
```
