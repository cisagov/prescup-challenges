## Getting Started

The Transport Management Portal is a new web application that is still being developed and tested. Its purpose is to manage and monitor various features of the Dauntless. 

Your goal is to find the five tokens hidden in the challenge environment by exploring the application, exploiting common web application vulnerabilities/misconfigurations, and creating users on the website to elevate your access. 
 
A careless user left their credentials on a sticky note under the keyboard. This might be a good place to start. They appear to have started some type of testing using a word list that is mounted as an ISO on the Kali machine's CDROM drive.

## Submission

There are five tokens for you to retrieve. All tokens are eight character hexadecimal strings.

## Questions

1. Provide the value of token1
2. Provide the value of token2
3. Provide the value of token3
4. Provide the value of token4
5. Provide the value of token5
