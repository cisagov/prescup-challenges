## Background

This morning, a VIP within our company accessed his computer and found that all of his files seemed to be corrupted.
Upon further investigation, we determined that they were likely encrypted by some form of malware intentionally, because
there was a single executable file on his desktop that was not encrypted. We don't know what it does, and we'd like you
to find out.

## Getting Started

You will need standard malware reverse engineering tools to work through this executable.
