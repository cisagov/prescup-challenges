# The Rambler
#### Executive Order Category: Forensics / Data Analysis

## Background
HUMINT (human intelligence) has determined that in-field agents report into some sort of Web
presence in order to pass secrets up a terrorist chain of command. The method of passing this
information is as of yet undetermined, but it is thought to be a mechanism for conveying GPS
targeting information.

It has long been thought that this organization was looking to target innocents on US soil -
could this be related?

Also, oddly, interrogation kept finding persons referring to a "Leon Ray Livingston," but the
nature of the connection could not be determined at present.

## Getting Started
Analyze the included `rambler_logs.log` file, identify the method of communication used, isolate
the relevant log entries, and recover the flag.

The flag is in the form of GPS coordinates (e.g., `##°##′##′′N ##°##′##′′W`).
