# Operation Rheinübung
#### Category: Securely Provision
#### Difficulty Level: 2000
#### Executive Order Category: Obfuscated Coding

## Background

Because you're good with computers, it's inevitable that your family treats you as tech support. Over the holidays,
Uncle John, a World War II buff, tells you that he's found a binary on his computer that seems like malware. What's
better, he has a copy for you to investigate further! He tells you that he's been looking at it with various tools and
even tried scripted attacks against it with Python, but to no avail. Uncle John looks you in the eye and asks you to
unlock its secrets. Now the entire family eyes you intently over holiday dinner -- can you unlock the secrets of this
binary file?

## Getting Started

This challenge will require some reverse engineering skills to solve. During the competition, a Kali VM was provided
with Radare2 installed, but participants were allowed to download this challenge. You may use whatever tools you want
in order to solve the challenge. You will know when you've solved the challenge when you find
`pcupCTF{somephraseinbrackets}`.
