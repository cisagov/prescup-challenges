Competitor Artifacts

In lieu of accessing the challenge's virtual environment, you may use the artifacts listed below to partially conduct some of the tasks of the challenge offline. Many portions of the challenge cannot be done outside of the virtual challenge environment. An answer key can be found [here](./competitor/answers.md)

Breakroom Task
- [sample-traffic.pcapng](./competitor/sample-traffic.pcapng) -- a pcap file that contains the traffic necessary to solve the breakroom task.

Garage Task
- [cipher.py](./competitor/garage/cipher.py) -- the cipher.py file from the hidden garage device's website.
- [keys.txt](./competitor/garage/keys.txt) -- the keys file from the hidden garage device's website.
- [robots.txt](./competitor/garage/robots.txt) -- the robots file from the hidden garage device's website.
- [sample-traffic.pcapng](./competitor/sample-traffic.pcapng) -- a pcap file that contains the traffic necessary to solve the garage task when using the artifacts above.

Lab Task (Generator)
 - [generator-webfiles.zip](./competitor/lab/generator-webfiles.zip) -- exemplar webfiles from the generator's website. The site files will not operate as intended unless it is run with a VM configuration that mirrors what is in the hosted challenge. The files are provided as a reference only.
 - [manual.pdf](./competitor/lab/manual.pdf) -- the generator's manual, found in the challenge on the generator's website.
 - [fridge device](./fridge1/app.py) -- This file handles running the server that presents the device labeled `fridge1` which is required to solve task 4. All the files in this folder are required to run the script.
 - [update server](./update_server/server.py) -- This file handles running the server that presents the `update server` which is required to solve task 4. All the files in this folder are required to run the script.
