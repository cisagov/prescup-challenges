## Background

You've gone undercover to infiltrate a hacker group. The hacker group is unaware that you are a U.S. Government employee and they are interested in your services. They will bring you onboard--*if* you prove you are built differently. Can you look at things differently and find their four color-based tokens? Having you inside the hacker group would be a game changer!

## Getting Started

Review the Apache 2 hacker website at `10.1.1.155`. Scan and examine it to discover the four tokens. Each token starts with one of these colors: **Red**, **White**, **Blue**, or **Black** and is followed by five more characters (e.g., RedHorse). Find these tokens to prove your worth--whether they are advertising the tokens or not. Attempting to login to `10.1.1.155` is unauthorized and not required to solve this challenge. In fact, the hacker group may dismiss you if you try to login to `10.1.1.155`! It also does not matter that the site is running Apache.

Show you are different by demonstrating you can look at data differently. Look for patterns and differences.

Some files may not be found in standard Kali wordlists. Look around. Create your own, if needed. The security of this operation depends on you.
