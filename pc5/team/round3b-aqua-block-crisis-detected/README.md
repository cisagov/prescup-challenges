## Background

A dam was the recent target of an advanced persistent threat (APT) group. Nothing malicious was detectedâ€¦*yet*. However, employee credentials were compromised, and malware was planted on the SCADA system. Employees have attempted to remove their history, logs, and communications.

-	Investigate and find the leaked password
-	Use the leaked credentials to discover the malware on the SCADA system

A list of usernames or passwords is unavailable; but, rumors say usernames are lowercase, common first names, and passwords are username plus a couple of digits. 

## Getting Started

SCADA and supporting infrastructure are on `10.1.1.0/24` and `10.2.2.0/24`. You are authorized to enumerate, scan, and log into these systems.

Enumerate the network users, discover their credentials, understand how the credentials were leaked, gain access to the SCADA, and find the malware.

## Challenge Questions

1. What is the password that was disclosed?
2. What is the username/handle of the creator of the malware planted on the SCADA system?
