## Background

You've been tasked with retrieving important data hosted on three different websites. Enumerate each website to find any vulnerability that allows you to log into each website. The URLs of the target websites and associated task(s) are as follows.

1. `http://baratie.merch.codes`: successfully log in 
2. `http://impel.merch.codes`: successfully log in
3. `https://baroque.merch.codes`: determine the owner; successfully log into owner's account

## Getting Started

On the Kali VM, browse to one of the three websites noted above and begin analyzing it!

***Important!** If the websites are not immediately available upon starting the challenge, please wait a few minutes and try again.*


## Challenge Questions

1. What is the 8 character hex string found after successfully logging into the website `http://baratie.merch.codes`?
2. What is the 8 character hex string found after successfully logging into the website `http://impel.merch.codes`?
3. What is the 8 character string found on `https://baroque.merch.codes` after logging into the account of the website owner?
