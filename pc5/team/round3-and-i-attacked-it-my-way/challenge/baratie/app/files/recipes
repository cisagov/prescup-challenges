   1. Make chicken drumstick tulips. Use kitchen scissors to cut the meat loose from the handle end of the drumstick. Roll the meat down the bone until it is fully inside-out at the end.
   2. Soak the breadcrumbs in milk. Knead mix in a bowl, then add breadcrumbs and knead again.
   3. Fold the meaty end of the drumstick around a hard-boiled egg. If the meat doesnt cover well enough, add cuts to loosen it up. Oil hands lightly and cover drumstick and egg with step 2. breadcrumb mixture.
   4. Bake at 400F (200C) for 1520 minutes, watching carefully.

   3. 1 Large Onion (or 2 Smaller Onions), diced
   4. 1 Celery Stalk, finely diced
   5. 2 Cloves Garlic, minced
   6. 1 Knob of Ginger (10g), minced
   7. 2 Potatoes, chopped
   8. 2 Carrots, chopped
   9. 2 Tomatoes, diced
   10. Cornstarch
   11. Curry Powder
   12. Garam Masala
   13. Bay Leaves
   14. Butter
   15. Oil
   16. Salt
   17. Pepper
   18. Honey
   19. Rice (about 3 cups)
 - Steps
   1. In a frying pan on medium-high heat, cook the chopped meat with some butter until lightly seared then put aside.
   2. In the same pan cook the potatoes and carrots with some butter until slightly golden on the outside then also put aside.
   3. In a large pot on medium heat, cook the garlic and ginger in about a tablespoon of oil until fragrant, then add the onions and celery to the pot.
   4. Once the onions and celery are soft, add about  tablespoon of honey and cook until slightly golden in color.
   5. Turn down the heat to low. Add 2 tablespoons of oil, 3 tablespoons of curry powder, 3 tablespoons of cornstarch, and  tablespoon of garam masala. Stir and cook for about 5 min. It should turn into a thick paste.
   6. To the curry paste you just made, add the diced tomatoes, stir, and cook for another 2-3 mins.
   7. Add the stock to the pot slowly and mix well.
   8. Add the pre-cooked meat and vegetables, a generous amount of salt, and 2 bay leaves to the pot. The stock should be just covering all the goodies (if not add boiling water). Simmer on low heat for 30-40mins. Make sure to check on it and stir every now and then so the curry doesnt stick to the bottom of the pot as it thickens.
   9. Once the vegetables and meat are tenderly cooked through, add salt to taste and take off the heat. You can also add more garam masala or chili to taste if you like.
   10. Pour the curry over a plate of rice and voil! Youve just made a tasty Japanese curry from scratch!
