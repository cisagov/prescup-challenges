## IMPORTANT
This challenge is only partially open sourced. The files in the [challenge directory](./challenge) are provided to give a starting point if you want to recreate the challenge on your own. The full challenge can be completed on the hosted site.

## Background

Your infrastructure is under attack. Use network traffic and intel reports on countries and advanced persistent threats (APT) to determine who this adversary is. Once discovered, gain a shell within their "**Achilles Heel**" located in their critical IP block.

You don't have shell access to the systems you must defend. Use network traffic to get the job done!

## Getting Started

Three countries/APT groups are responsible for the attacks. Intel reports these adversaries use weak usernames and passwords, vulnerable software, and untrusted code.

In the gamespace, browse to `challenge.us/files`. Wait **five minutes** for three files to become available for download: apts-and-ips.tar.gz.ctr, apts.tar.gz, and readme.txt.

Review the contents of the files, determine the answers to the questions on `challenge.us`, and gain shell access to the three **Achilles Heel** machines within each country's Suspected Critical IP Block to get the tokens. There are three six-digit tokens.

## Challenge Questions

1. What is Token 1?
2. What is Token 2?
3. What is Token 3?
