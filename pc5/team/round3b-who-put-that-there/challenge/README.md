# Who Put That There?

*Challenge Artifacts*

This challenge consists of a PCAP file containing file transfers to a remote server.  The goal is to match a hash of a file to the ip that uploaded it.

## ⚠️ Large Files ⚠️
This challenge includes large files as a separate download. Please download the large files [here](https://presidentscup.cisa.gov/files/pc5/teams-round3b-who-put-that-there-largefiles.zip). The packet capture file extracted from the large file zip was provided to competitors as an ISO during the competition. The zipped file is ~74 MBs and the extracted file is ~83 MBs.

- [team-round3b-who-put-that-there-largefiles.zip](https://presidentscup.cisa.gov/files/pc5/teams-round3b-who-put-that-there-largefiles.zip) - This file is a large zip file containing the file transfers.

- [hashlist.txt](./hashlist.txt) - This is a list of hashes matched to file name and ip that uploaded it.  **This is the answer key**
