## IMPORTANT
This challenge does not have any downloadable artifacts. You may complete this challenge in the hosted environment.

## Background

The company is concerned personnel are engaging in unmonitored communications. Investigate the events described below and validate the threats.

## Getting Started

There are four questions in this challenge. Each question has an associated zip file (**q1.zip**, **q2.zip**, **q3.zip**, and **q4.zip**) that must be downloaded from `challenge.us/files`; however, it may take ***up to five minutes*** for all four zip files to become available for download.

### Question 1

A seven-letter `PASSCODE` was sent via email communications in an obfuscated manner. Determine who sent the `PASSCODE` and what the seven-letter `PASSCODE` was.

### Question 2

The organization wants to know where personnel have been because that may affect their clearance. Determine what other picture in the **q2.zip** was taken in the same town as the **town.jpg** picture. These are real towns in the United States and open-source intelligence (OSINT) performed outside of the gamespace is required.

### Question 3

Various internal images were leaked. Determine the image within the **2-final** directory that has the same original owner as the **lead.jpg** image. *Hint:* more images (**1-middle**) may be helpful.

### Question 4

Secret words are being put on top of large images that go unnoticed unless you know where to look (similar to **Where's Waldo?**). We captured two images (original and modified with a secret word). Determine the seven-letter word placed on top of the **q4-heic1502-secret.tif** file.

## Challenge Questions

1. (q1.zip) What is the seven-letter PASSCODE that was sent through the email traffic?
2. (q2.zip) What is the filename (NO extension) of the image that was taken at the same town as the town.jpg image?
3. (q3.zip) What is the filename (NO extension) of the image in the 2-final directory that had the same original owner as the lead.jpg image?
4. (q4.zip) What three-digit number was placed somewhere within the q4-heic1502-secret.tif file?
