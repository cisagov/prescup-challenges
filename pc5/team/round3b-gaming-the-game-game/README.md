After a lot of work on the ship, you finally have some free time and decide to play a game. No one has been able to beat the top score. Your goal is to find ways to beat the game as fast as possible and beat the top score!


## Getting Started

In the gamespace, browse to `challenge.us/files` and download the game client, `game_client.py`. Use this client to access the game server. It is recommended that you play the game to better understand how to beat the game!

After completing the **"time"** quest, you will be given the **Time** token. Then, after obtaining the top score, you will obtain the **Final** token. Good luck!
