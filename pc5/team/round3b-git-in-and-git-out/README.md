## Background

Given access to a developer machine through SSH, exploit their development environment and retrieve two (2) tokens. The first token is on the web server (`10.7.7.100`) and is presented after gaining administrator credentials. The second token is in a GitLab project owned by `root`.

## Getting Started

You've been given access to a developer machine (`10.1.1.50`). Use the tools available to assess how vulnerable our systems and forward-facing website are to attack if a developer machine should be compromised. There are two tokens to retrieve. Both tokens are six-character hexadecimal strings.

## Challenge Questions

1. Enter Token 1.
2. Enter Token 2.
