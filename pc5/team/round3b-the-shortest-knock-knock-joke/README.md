**NICE Task**

- [T0549](https://niccs.cisa.gov/workforce-development/nice-framework/): Perform technical (evaluation of technology) and nontechnical (evaluation of people and operations) risk and vulnerability assessments of relevant technology focus areas (e.g., local computing environment, network and infrastructure, enclave boundary, supporting infrastructure, and applications).

## Background

A server on the network has an open port. Find the open port on the server. Connect to it, send data, and receive the token.

## Getting Started

Search for an IP address *other* than `10.200.200.5`. Do not interfere with the `10.200.200.5` server. From there, find the open port.

## Challenge Questions

1. Connect to the server on the correct open port and send any string. You will receive the token.
