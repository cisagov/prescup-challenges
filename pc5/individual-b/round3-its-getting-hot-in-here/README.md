**NICE Tasks**

- [T0028](https://niccs.cisa.gov/workforce-development/nice-framework/): Conduct and/or support authorized penetration testing on enterprise network assets.
- [T0570](https://niccs.cisa.gov/workforce-development/nice-framework/): Apply and utilize authorized cyber capabilities to enable access to targeted networks.
- [T0591](https://niccs.cisa.gov/workforce-development/nice-framework/): Perform analysis for target infrastructure exploitation activities.

## Background

Use the provided Kali machine to explore and exploit various SCADA systems, gather data about the enemy's network, and disable their ship using offensive tools and techniques.

## Getting Started

Log into the `kali` VM, scan the network for various SCADA clients and servers, and browse to `http://reactors.merch.codes` to begin interacting with enemy systems. In addition to the standard tools installed with Kali,  **Control Things Modbus** (`ctmodbus`) and **Python Modbus** (`pymodbus`) are provided. A shortcut to `ctmodbus` is provided on the desktop of the Kali VM and the `pymodbus` library has been included for use with Python scripts.

>**Note:** If you use Security Onion to complete this challenge, it may take 5 to 8 minutes after launching the challenge to become available.   
>**Note:** If you choose to use Security Onion for creating PCAP files, make sure to enter `securityonion` in the `Sensor ID` field. Log into Security Onion at `10.4.4.4` through a browser or via SSH.  

## Submissions

There are four (4) tokens to retrieve in this challenge. Here are some additional details about each token. The ScadaWeb web application is located at `http://reactors.merch.codes`. From the Kali VM, navigate to `https://challenge.us` to grade the challenge.

**Token 1:** Locate and interact with the Scada Reactor Server software running on the reactor servers and retrieve the Software Version. Capturing network traffic from the ScadaWeb web application may be helpful to locate these servers. The version information will be displayed in the following format: `0.0.0`. 

**Token 2:** Find the SCADA server that is controlling the Atmosphere Motor Controller. Interact with the server, manipulating coil values until the client becomes unresponsive and stops sending data to the server. Verify the results at `https://challenge.us`.

**Token 3:** Use the ScadaWeb application to manipulate the two reactor servers and gain insight into how the web client and servers work. Use this knowledge, along with network traffic captures and other tools, to increase the temperature of the two reactors until they report an error about imminent failure to the ScadaWeb application. Verify the results at `https://challenge.us`.

**Token 4:** Clear the logs in the ScadaWeb web application to help cover your activities. Be careful not to break the application or the database. Verify the results at `https://challenge.us`.
