## Background 

Your spaceship is searching for five spaceships suspected of nefarious activity in the Elysium Nova System. You have a star map and an informant who wants to help! 

The informant has provided additional information on the Elysium Nova System and the five starships. They have prepared a data "hand-off" on the `10.1.1.0/24` subnet. Using the informant's data and your star map, write a script that helps you locate the five rogue vessels and answer the challenge questions. 

## Getting Started 

On the Kali virtual machine, visit `challenge.us` and download the two available files. 

- **Elysium_Nova_System.png:** The star map which contains a celestial map of the Elysium Nova System with astronomical objects laid out on a grid system.
- **ENS_info.txt:** This file contains supplemental information about the star map.

## Hint

The term "visited" in all the questions for this challenge refers to a specific data point provided from the informant that when plotted overlaps with a celestial body on the provided star map.
