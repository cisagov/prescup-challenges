## Background

The company has discovered a brand-new, unauthorized internal cryptocurrency financial network. 25 digital currency wallets and an entire blockchain was used across an internal (regtest) Litecoin (LTC) blockchain. Find the person who is responsible for this operation based on the blocks and transactions. This person of interest sends and receives transactions across different social groups.

This zip file has everything you need to interact with the blockchain and wallets. **Be patient!** It may take up to three minutes for the `regtest.zip` file to appear.
