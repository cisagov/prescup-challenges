# Branching Out

The new Branch office officially opened today and while you hoped it would go off without a hitch, the IT support tickets are piling up. Donâ€™t get *blown* away! *Leaf* through the requests and get to the *root* of the problem.

## Background

The help desk inbox began filling up as soon as employees arrived at work. After the initial triage, two issues were identified:

1. Users at the Main office are unable to connect to server 192.168.2.11 located at the Branch office, or access any resources in the Branch office.

2. Users at the Branch office are blaming security tools for disconnecting their sessions to the 192.168.2.11 server, interfering with their work. They ask when server 192.168.2.12 will be ready for production so they have a backup system to work from.

## Getting Started

Internet connectivity at the **Branch office** appears to be unaffected. A remote console (`kali-branch`) has been set up to assist with troubleshooting. Additionally, a console for `192.168.2.11` is available to aid in resolving the issues. You are authorized to make any necessary network changes to address the reported problems.

A **Grading Check** is accessible at `challenge.us` to monitor your progress. Please allow up to one (1) minute for the Grading Check to complete after pressing the **Grade Challenge** button.

> **Note:** Network connectivity between the Main office and Branch office *must* be in place before attempting to grade Question 2.

When an issue is resolved, you will receive a token. These tokens are required to answer **Question 1** and **Question 2** of the Challenge.

## Challenge Questions

1. What is the 8-digit hexadecimal code you received from the grading check (`challenge.us`) for Task 1?
2. What is the 8-digit hexadecimal code you received from the grading check (`challenge.us`) for Task 2?
