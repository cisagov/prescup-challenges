## Background

We developed our new web application, admin-tools.us. We deployed it not too long ago. Ever since, it has been nothing but a headache. Please, if you could, find the issues planted in the application in the form of tokens.

## Getting Started

Visit admin-tools.us. From there, try to get the credentials and log in as an admin. Afterwards, follow the tasks below to complete the exercise.

## Submission Format

There are three different submission tokens for this exercise:

- Log in as an admin
- Try to get the contents of "token.txt" by using the admin tools.
- Get the final token by sending a GET request to our secret server.

Find these tokens and submit them as the answer to the relevant questions.
