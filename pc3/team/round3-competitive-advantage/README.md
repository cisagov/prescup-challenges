  ## Background  

  Your employer's corporate structure is large and complex and includes a little-known retail operation. The retail operation is struggling to secure hot-ticket items from the distributor. While it's outside your normal job scope, the CEO has personally asked you to help out. The retail operation is struggling, and if it can't get these items in stock, its position in the marketplace will be jeopardized. 


  ## Getting Started

  Log in to the provided Kali machine. Use your browser to navigate to `http://wholesaler.us`. The credentials are `kowalski` and `tartans`. Click the `Products` link at the top and peruse the list of items this distributor stocks. The top two, `Blue Party Hat` and `Bandanna`, are usually out of stock. They are very popular this holiday season, and the retail arm of your employer needs to have them available to customers.  

  The CEO occasionally sees the quantity available rise above 0, but by the time he adds it to his cart and gets to checkout, they are out of stock. He doesn't know how, but he's sure other retailers are cheating to get these items.  

  Use the tools at your disposal to order at least one `Blue Party Hat` and at least one `Bandanna`. You can score your progress by visiting `http://challenge.us` from a browser within the challenge environment. The solution tokens will be displayed by the grading service as you place orders that secure the requested products.

  ## Submission Format

  There are two (2) grading checks for this challenge. Each token corresponds to a different product being successfully ordered. Each token consists of 8-character hexadecimal values.
