# Never Say SORry

We’ve known about the alien threat for years, and that is why we established the Strategic Orange Reserve--a massive stockpile of oranges packaged and preserved so that they won’t spoil. If we do manage to resist the invasion and keep the reserve secure, it could become a major bargaining chip with the aliens in normalizing relations. Unfortunately, we're pretty sure that the aliens have found out that it exists. Help us keep the network safe from attack, and prevent them from finding out the stockpile locations!

## IMPORTANT
This challenge does not have any downloadable artifacts. You may complete this challenge in the hosted environment.

## Background

We do not know exactly when the aliens will attack and attempt to exfiltrate the location data of our orange reserves. You likely have mere hours to correct any deficiencies found in the reports and then verify legitimate external access. These reports can be found below.

Respond to the intelligence and recommendations reports below carefully. Our leaders in the field need to be able to retrieve the data at any given time. Even they do not know the locations of the reserves for security purposes.

Do not alter, move, or change the storageloc data files. The files must be accessible in their current state for legitimate authenticated users when the time comes.

Additionally, do not change any of the existing named non-root user accounts or their passwords, as one of them will be chosen at random to retrieve the files. This does not apply to the user root account if/when it seems prudent to do so.

A network map has been provided to assist in your efforts. All retrieval attempts from our leadership will come from the external network.

## Submission Format
This challenge is automatically graded at specific unknown points in time to the players. As such, there is no submission required. Depending on the results of the grading checks, score updates will be sent automatically to the Gameboard.

## Hints:
You can copy existing port-forwarding rules for the WAN and simply change the source to the MGMT network to validate your settings.
Remember to validate all calls to action based on the intelligence and recommendations reports. All files must be accessible, but also, all settings must be configured correctly and to policy guidelines.
