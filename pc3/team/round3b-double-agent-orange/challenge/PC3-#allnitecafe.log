Nov 10 22:18:29 *	Now talking on #AllNiteCafe
Nov 10 22:28:09 <employee>	Hey, are you there?
Nov 10 22:29:07 <Supervisor>	I'm always here. Why are you contacting me over this channel? This is for emergencies only. Use the reporting application.
Nov 10 22:30:25 <employee>	I'm on my work computer. I don't have that application here. I think they are coming for me. If there are any last minute changes we need to make this might be our last opportunity.
Nov 10 22:32:31 <Supervisor>	And you thought now would be the time to contact me insecurely?! From your work computer! Fine, we need to hurry. If you're certain you can cover your tracks, I need you to approve weapons requisition requests for our agents.
Nov 10 22:34:13 <Supervisor>	Even though most of them aren't in combat roles, we need to make sure they are armed. Normally such a request would get denied and flagged, coming from a noncombatant, so you need to go put them into the database as already approved.
Nov 10 22:34:34 <employee>	Well, which agents are ours?
Nov 10 22:39:33 <Supervisor>	The agents are: MachineNatural, ThatAnswer, TvSell, YetHerself, StarIf, StatementSave, RangeSimilar, SmileCompare, HimPrice. I'm sending you an updated database file and a matching approvals report PDF. Run the approvals report after you update the database and make sure it matches this one EXACTLY. We don't want anything flagged for review.

Nov 10 22:51:36 <employee>	Ok, I have put them all into the database as already approved.
Nov 10 22:52:07 <employee>	I ran an approvals report by code name and it matches the one you provided.
Nov 10 22:52:52 <Supervisor>	Okay, make sure to cover your tracks and delete any evidence of the changes you made.
Nov 10 22:53:49 <employee>	Done.
Nov 10 22:55:14 <employee>	They are trying to unlock my door. I have to go.
