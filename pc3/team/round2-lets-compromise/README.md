  # Let's Compromise
  
  
  Your organization's network has been found to contain multiple Indicators of Compromise. Your job is to find them, submit your findings, and then mitigate them. 

  **NICE Work Roles:**   

  [Cyber Defense Incident Responder](https://niccs.cisa.gov/workforce-development/nice-framework/workroles?name=Cyber+Defense+Incident+Responder&id=All)

  [Cyber Defense Analyst](https://niccs.cisa.gov/workforce-development/nice-framework/workroles?name=Cyber%20Defense%20Analyst&id=All&fwid=All&name_selective=Cyber%20Defense%20Analyst)

  - [T0041](https://niccs.cisa.gov/workforce-development/nice-framework/tasks?id=T0041&description=All) -  Coordinate and provide expert technical support to enterprise-wide cyber defense technicians to resolve cyber defense incidents.
  - [T0023](https://niccs.cisa.gov/workforce-development/nice-framework/tasks?id=T0023&description=All) - Characterize and analyze network traffic to identify anomalous activity and potential threats to network resources.
  - [T0258](https://niccs.cisa.gov/workforce-development/nice-framework/tasks?id=T0258&description=All) - Provide timely detection, identification, and alerting of possible attacks/intrusions, anomalous activities, and misuse activities and distinguish these incidents and events from benign activities.

## IMPORTANT
This challenge does not have any downloadable artifacts. You may complete this challenge in the hosted environment.

  ## Background  

  Your organization was doing their scheduled checkup of all hosts on their network when they found that there were multiple Indicators of Compromise found within a cluster of machines. 

  They have asked you and your team to access the machines noted with the IOCs, find what is causing the anomalous activity, record which machines have which kind of IOC, and then do your best to mitigate all of them. 

  They have also supplied your team with an intel document noting what kinds of IOCs to look out for as they have heard from others in the field what they have been experiencing as of late. 

  ## Getting Started

  Log on to any one of the machines available to start. Each one will have the discussed intel document on their Desktop for you to reference. 

  ## Submission Format
 
  There are 7 submission parts. Parts 1 through 6 will check for proper mapping of IOCs to the correct host they are on. Part 7 will check that you have mitigated all the IOCs.

  You should visit the challenge server inside the environment at `http://challenge.us` to perform the final mitigation check in order to receive that submission token.

  The final submission token is ONLY given once ALL of the found IOCs have been mitigated. There is no partial credit for this submission.

  PLEASE NOTE: The mitigation check is done via SSH on port 22. If you close that port on any machine, you will not be able to get the submission token.
