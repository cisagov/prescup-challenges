## Background  

Another dark web bulletin board has popped up, but intelligence analysts suspect the administrator behind this operation is inexperienced and ignorant of web security best practices. You are authorized to perform a unobtrusive assessment of the application - look around, see what can be done, but don't break anything. 


## Getting Started

Log in to your Kali workstation, open a browser, and navigate to `http://192.168.1.100`. You have three main objectives:
  1. Gain administrator access
  2. Recover a specific user password
  3. Discover another active user session

## Submission Format

There are three (3) grading checks for this challenge. The Admin Token and Recovered Password are both 8-character hexadecimal values. The discovered session is a username string consisting of only alphabetic characters.
