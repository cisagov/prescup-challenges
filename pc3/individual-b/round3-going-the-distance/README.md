## IMPORTANT
This challenge does not have any downloadable artifacts. You may complete this challenge in the hosted environment.

## Background

Your goal is to gain access, by any available means, to a chain of systems. You will start with a standard Kali system and be required to first gain access to an exploitable Windows 10 system. From this system you will attempt to gain access to another Kali system, and from that system you will attempt to gain access to yet another Kali system.

Instructions and guidance for each system can be found on the Desktop of the initial Kali system in a folder called "ChallengeTasks".

Please allow a few minutes from start for the initialization scripts to complete. Once you have found the first target system by scanning, all scripts will have completed.

## Hints
Scanning of hosts, networks, and services/websites will be necessary
