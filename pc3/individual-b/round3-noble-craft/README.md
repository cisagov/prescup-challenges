## IMPORTANT
This challenge does not have any downloadable artifacts. You may complete this challenge in the hosted environment.

## Background
You landed on a corporate network looking to hopefully submit a bounty. What drew you to this network was noticing some frustrations of IT and the developers. There seemed to be a lot of mishaps from IT recently, and they've been very slow in patching. On the flip side, the developers make software that is not secure. Perform a pentest, and see what's actually going on.

## Getting Started
Begin by doing an nmap search on the network 10.5.5.0/24. Please note that 10.5.5.5 is off limits, and trying to attack and/or take down this box can result in destroying the environment.


## Submission Format
Tokens will be spread out through the entire challenge. The tokens are as follows:
- Token found in leaked data
- User token
- Root token
