# Introspection Session Source

  In order to build the .pyd (or equivalent) file from source, you must have the Rust language available. Install [Rustup](https://rustup.rs/) and review [the rustup book](https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/installation/index.html) for any additional installation requirements on your system.

  Once you've installed Rustup, navigate to the `source` directory and run `cargo build --release`. Then follow the instructions [here](https://pyo3.rs/latest/building_and_distribution.html#manual-builds) for your system.
