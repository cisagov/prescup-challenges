# Introspection Session

Analyze a Python extension module.

## Background

  We recovered a suspicious file with the extension ".pyd" from a recent incident and want to find out more. It appears to be related to Python, but we weren't really sure how to approach it.

## Getting Started

  The file is accessible in the `challenge` directory. Use any tools you want to analyze the file's behavior and learn what it does, and then investigate further based on that behavior.

## Submission

  All four tokens are 16-character hex strings embedded within the .pyd file.

## Additional Information

  The source code for the .pyd file is included in the `solution` directory.
