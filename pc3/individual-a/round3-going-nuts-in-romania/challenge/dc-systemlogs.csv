If this is the first occurrence of this event for the specified computer and account, this may be a transient issue that doesn't require any action at this time. Otherwise, the following steps may be taken to resolve this problem:  

If 'GRANT$' is a legitimate machine account for the computer 'GRANT', then 'GRANT' should be rejoined to the domain.  

If 'GRANT$' is a legitimate interdomain trust account, then the trust should be recreated.  

Otherwise, assuming that 'GRANT$' is not a legitimate account, the following action should be taken on 'GRANT':  

If 'GRANT' is a Domain Controller, then the trust associated with 'GRANT$' should be deleted.
