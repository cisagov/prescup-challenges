# Hospital

A nearby rural hospital has been hit with a ransomware attack. This small hospital didn’t have a secure cyber defense and was targeted by cyber criminals. As a mitigation measure the hospital has shut down all affected systems. Without the ability to remotely bring in specialists, order tests, or supply medications, the hospital’s emergency room has been forced to go on diversion.
