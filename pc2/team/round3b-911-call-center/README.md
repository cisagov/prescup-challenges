## IMPORTANT

This challenge is only partially open sourced. You may complete the full challenge in the hosted environment.

## Background

This small hospital didn't have a secure cyber defense and was targeted by cyber-criminals. As a mitigation measure, the hospital has shut down all affected systems. Without the ability to remotely bring in specialists, order tests, or supply medications,
the hospital's emergency room has been forced to go on diversion. This has increased the load on other nearby hospitals as well as forced emergency responders
to travel further on treacherous roads. Your team must remediate the infection on all affected systems, while preventing the malware from spreading further.
The situation is endangering patients\u2019 lives. It's up to your team to help save them.  Cyber-criminals have demanded 1.5 million dollars in an apparent extortion scheme, threatening to disable 911 services across the region if their demands are not met. Needless to say, the loss of 911 services during the current winter storm
would have catastrophic consequences. The ransom message indicated that if the ransom was not paid before midnight, then attacks would be launched. However, payment of the ransom would set an unacceptable precedent. You will be provided with all available intelligence about previous attacks by suspected criminal organizations as well as a sample of known attack tools. Your team must properly identify likely incoming threats and harden the network in order to ensure continuity
of operations.

You have been provided a [network map](./challenge/network_diagram.png) and various security bulletins in the [challenge](./challenge/) folder.

By analyzing the extortion threat and cross-referencing it with the information provided via the Log Book and Digital References, the players will have to come to a conclusion on which group they believe propagated the attack.

## Submission Format

This challenge was presented in a video game format, the win conditions were determined by accomplishing the following:

Set up the proper defense to prevent the attack from happening. 

By knowing the group executing the attack as well as their previous methodologies, players will have to setup proper cyber defenses to ensure the attack causes zero to minimum damage. This could include using the Tools Laptop and Server Rack located in the networking cabinet. The Server Rack will have 5 Servers.

The team will be notified that their defense either succeeded or failed to prevent the attack.	

This was evaluated 45 minutes before the end of the Experience. Teams were be awarded points based on how well their defenses were constructed.
