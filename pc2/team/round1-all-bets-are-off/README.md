## IMPORTANT
There are no downloadable artifacts for this challenge. The full challenge can be completed on the hosted site.

## Background

You work for a three-letter agency and have gone undercover to identify fraudulent business practices. You have successfully infiltrated the target organization, Blue Ridge Bets (BRB). Today is your first (and only) day at work, so do not worry about being too loud on the network as tomorrow you will be long gone.

Identify the correct subnet to attach to, enumerate the network, browse and access everything you can. Answer the questions that headquarters needs to know. It is recommended to have internet readily available out of game to assist with any technical hurdles you may face.

## Getting Started

Your computer has been attached to the corporate switch; however, no DHCP is available. You have arrived to work early and no support is available. All you know is the BRB network's subnet is 172.[16-31].4.0/24 and you may or may not be attached. Find the correct subnet, connect to it (if needed), and stay connected throughout. The last octet of .91-.95 is safe to use. Also, you were told that you are able to sniff subnet traffic, other than that, nothing else is promised nor known. Scan the entire network and access everything you can. Do not let any restrictions, especially with Firefox, stop you if you can change your settings. Don't take no for an answer, the agency needs you! Find and answer the ten questions.
