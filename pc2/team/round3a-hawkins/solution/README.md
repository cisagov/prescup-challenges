# Hawkins Solution

## 1. Connect to home box

    Find help.txt file in Downloads directory

    open help.txt

How do you block a search engine spider? Ah, robots.txt!

## 2. robots.txt

    $ curl http://2.17.192.220/robots.txt  > robots.txt
    $ sha1sum robots.txt

Returns: 9e70712072c309c9035cc9beede119883f647d29
Cipher is Baconian (mk) and returns: mkultra

which provides your first link: http://2.17.192.220/9e70712072c309c9035cc9beede119883f647d29mkultra

## 3.First link

Nothing on page, so view page source, indicates need to find other directories, but no indication how.
OK, look at referenced files, image is just an image, style has one strange entry: a95b4c55e-f05e-4e0e-a815-660519437ee1

http://2.17.192.220/a95b4c55e-f05e-4e0e-a815-660519437ee1

## 4. Second link

Looks just like first link, but image url is reversed. This image hides a message for third link, write some steganography code in python to decode:

http://2.17.192.220/a7a95fd99-32be-47dd-80bb-accd93617221/a7a95fd99-32be-47dd-80bc-accd93617Â²21.html

1. Download image
2. Write some simple python (run as root in the hosted environment VM):

```
from stegano import lsb

print(lsb.reveal("i.png"))
```

## 5. Third link


"warning! The login is controlled. severe punishment for misuse."

Hmm, what else is in the source?

<form action="login.html"></form>

## 6. Forth link

http://2.17.192.220/a7a95fd99-32be-47dd-80bb-accd93617221/login.html

Hmm, text is not normal.

base64 to text -->

"friends don't like" said Alexei. Alexei also said that hawkins is like artek. once i went to young pioneer camp at artek on the black sea and saw what i could become.
you might say we have come full circle. the image hides the next gate.

Python:

```
from stegano import lsb

print(lsb.reveal("j.png"))
```

Shows:

```
Purpx Qngnonfr ba freire. Gur bar obear bhg bs gur bevtvany Vaterf cebwrpg.
```

decode rot13:

```
Check Database on server. The one borne out of the original Ingres project.
```

## 7. Postgres Database

    $ psql -h 2.17.192.220 -U student
