# Finding Footprints

The user must analyze disk image files to determine information about a planned attack.

**NICE Work Role:** 

- [Cyber Defense Forensics Analyst](https://niccs.cisa.gov/workforce-development/nice-framework)

**NICE Tasks:**

- [T0036](https://niccs.cisa.gov/workforce-development/nice-framework) - Confirm what is known about an intrusion and discover new information, if possible, after identifying intrusion via dynamic analysis.  
- [T0165](https://niccs.cisa.gov/workforce-development/nice-framework) to see the intrusion as the user may have seen it, in a native environment.  
- [T0286](https://niccs.cisa.gov/workforce-development/nice-framework) - Perform file system forensic analysis.  
-  [T0532](https://niccs.cisa.gov/workforce-development/nice-framework) for recovery of potentially relevant information.

## IMPORTANT
This challenge does not have any downloadable artifacts. The full challenge can be completed on the hosted site.

## Background

Your organization's security team has found rogue systems within a cluster of Windows 10 computers in their network.

The number of rogue machines is unknown as different IP’s randomly appear and disappear. Also, they seem to be running an operating system different than your standard build. Additionally, analysts have noticed encrypted traffic between some machines.
Four staff members were interviewed for suspicious activity. They won’t reveal who is working with them on the outside, nor what their plan is. Their machines have been removed from the network and you must analyze their machines to determine who else is involved, who/what they are targeting, and when they plan to execute their attack.


## Getting started

You have access to live images of the four suspect machines. You must determine:

-   The name of the person who is the external threat

-   The name of the person they are targeting

-   IP address of the target machine

-   The date of the planned attack


## Submission Format

When entering your submissions, please enter them in the following format:


-   Initials of External Threat

-   Initials of Internal Target

-   IP targeted

-   Date attack was going to take place (MM/DD/YYYY, there are no leading zeroes)
