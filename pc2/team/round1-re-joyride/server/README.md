# Reverse Engineering Joyride Server

## Running the Server

You will need to install the `pycryptodome` library in a Python 3.6+ environment. The provided `requirements.txt` can be used to install the same version that was used for the challenge, with `pip install -r requirements.txt` in a shell. Then run the server with `python server.py` or `python3 server.py` depending on your Python installation.
