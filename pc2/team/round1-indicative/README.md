## Indicative

  Given a PCAP containing malicious traffic, players must identify a specific threat.


  **NICE Work Role:**


  - [Cyber Defense Incident Responder](https://niccs.cisa.gov/workforce-development/nice-framework)


  **NICE Tasks:**


  - [T0161](https://niccs.cisa.gov/workforce-development/nice-framework) to identify possible threats to network security.

  - [T0163](https://niccs.cisa.gov/workforce-development/nice-framework) - Perform cyber defense incident triage, to include determining scope, urgency, and potential impact, identifying the specific vulnerability, and making recommendations that enable expeditious remediation.


  ## Background

  Your network is diverse, with several IoT devices on various subnets. An attacker at a single IP address is targeting your assets. Due to the sensitive nature of the devices on the network, the MAC Addresses have been zeroed out in the packet capture.


  ## Getting Started

  Examine the [PCAP](.\challenge\maliciousBehaviorPcap.pcapng) included in the [challenge](./challenge) folder that was taken during the attack period. You must identify the IP address which was targeted by a code execution exploit for Trendnet IP Cameras.

  ## Submission Format

  The answer to the challenge is the **IPv4 address** which was targeted with the mentioned exploit.
