## Getting Started (Data)

**NOTE**: Since the actual, public Bitcoin (production) blockchain is
approaching 250GB at the time of this writing, during this challenge
you are expected to use the Bitcoin software in `regtest` mode (as
also suggested by the name of the archived blockchain sample in the handout).

The Bitcoin addresses (public keys) associated with each user are shown
in the following table:

| User     | BTC Address                           |
|:---------|:--------------------------------------|
| Koinbase | `2NFRCaDA6LLd9gqKbygmD1HRj992T6KwM4k` |
| Allie    | `2NF2tXr1qxzyVZe1A3PJzfeMy8kkGxwAkt2` |
| Bubba    | `2N2pxfcWsLQgkmEEo9B7yPnb3pJbcipyi9g` |
| Chuck    | `2N8YHRTnbu4Jv3unDGFbfDNXn8QCeihbf4A` |
| DeeDee   | `2Mz1uxd5bZENNQtzjcKh5dcdXXh6qZtfwkg` |


The list of known illegal transactions made available to Koinbase by law
enforcement currently contains the following entry:

```
8d6e482252f84eaeeada387efb9ce56563ffc5bc42e4ec9d9119cfd4a6964611
```

and represents a a payment made by the victim of a ransomware attack to
their attacker, in a (futile) attempt to get their files unlocked.
