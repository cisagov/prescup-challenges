# Knockin' on Heaven's Door

Determine how an insider threat is exfiltrating data and replicate the attack to retrieve critical data.  Familiarity with Linux, iptables, network analysis tools, and scripting is expected.

## IMPORTANT

There are no downloadable artifacts for this challenge. The full challenge can be completed on the hosted site.


## Background
Adversaries, including malicious insiders, obfuscate their nefarious  activities any way they can. In this challenge, you will need to discover the attacker's methods, then recreate the attack in order to locate the files required for each flag submission.  

## Getting Started
Log in to your Kali workstation. Use any tools at your disposal to monitor the network and determine the attacker's approach. 

Then, reverse engineer the attack to access files that contain critical  information.  The submission codes will be stored in plain-text files alongside other files necessary to correlate each answer.

## Submission Format
The submission for this challenge is an 8-byte value represented by 16 hexadecimal digits. All letters will be lower case.
