## IMPORTANT
This challenge is only partially open sourced. The files in the [challenge directory](challenge) are provided to give a starting point if you want to recreate the challenge on your own. The full challenge can be completed on the hosted site.

## Getting started

Over the past weekend, there was an alert that suspicious traffic has been coming in and out of a machine within your network.
Your organization fears that the machine has been infected and has asked you to come in and investigate.
It is unknown at this time exactly what has occurred and what information is being transferred. You must determine what is causing these events and 
dispose of any malicious files or scripts that may be on the machine.    

Use your preferred platform and tools to locate and remove the cause of the suspicious events that are taking place.

## Submission Format
For this challenge your task is to eradicate the three main malicious scripts being executed. There will be a grading script that you can execute and when you have successfully mitigated the main threats on your machine, you will get a file sent to your Desktop that will contain the answer. 

Once all three are gone, run the command [grader](challenge/user/root-desktop/grader.sh) which will verify that all three have been deleted. If you have done this correctly, then the submission answer for the challenge will be output to the terminal.
