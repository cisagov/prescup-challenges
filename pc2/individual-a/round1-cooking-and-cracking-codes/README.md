## Background

You work for a three-letter agency and have been given six files to decode. Each file relates to a question your agency needs to answer, as these files are relevant to an investigation. 


## Getting Started

The six files to be decoded can be found within the challenge folder.

Answer the questions below as you decode the files related to the alleged perpetrator.  

## Questions

1. Regarding `1.txt`, your team found this script on an attacked machine. What command were the attackers trying to run?

2. Regarding `2.txt`, your team found another script that was being launched on startup. Decode the script; don’t be fooled by running it. How many `/dev/urandom` (not `/dev/random`) lines are overwriting the bash history in this command?

3. Regarding `3.txt`, decode and find out what the secret number is. What is the secret number?

4. Regarding `4.txt`, what three letters must be echoed instead of the five letters to print the current working directory?

5. Regarding `5.txt`, your boss believes this data possesses an XOR algorithm that provides a needed 8-bit key. What is the 8-bit key?

6. Regarding `6.txt`, this file was found on a suspected attacker’s machine. It was found alongside an encrypted journal and other personal thoughts. Find the flag within the data as it may help your agency decrypt the journal. The flag is only one word! Read everything!
