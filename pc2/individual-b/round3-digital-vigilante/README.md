## Getting started

You can view the [challenge guide](challenge-guide.pdf) here.

You met an anonymous friend via chat and have been going back and forth about something fishy that's been going on inside of the Makestuff company network.

Your friend works on the inside and heard rumors of a secret project that's been started and the name of the person heading it is being kept secret. 

He doesn't know what they're hiding but he found that there is a private web server being hosted in the network that he cannot access.

The server has to be hiding something, but sadly he can't do any more for fear of getting in trouble. He hopes you can pick up where he left off and determine what's going on as he worries that lives may be in danger.

In an attempt to help, your friend has left you a text document on the `kaliWan` machine with some useful information that he believes will help you get to the bottom of this situation. He transferred it to your Desktop labeled as `Readme.txt`.
