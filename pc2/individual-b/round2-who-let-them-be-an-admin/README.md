## IMPORTANT

This challenge does not have any downloadable artifacts. You may complete this challenge in the hosted environment.


## Background

We are conducting a vulnerability assessment of our internal systems. We recently discovered that our former network administrator was not entirely truthful on their resume. We want to make sure that this did not impact the security of these systems and need you to check the state of these systems to ensure they are secure.


## Getting Started

You are given a Kali VM within the same network as two other systems. You should begin by running appropriate scans against these targets.

The two systems have the following IP addresses:

- 10.10.10.60
- 10.10.10.61

## Submission Format

There are four tokens to be found for the challenge:

- One is in a database
- Three are from a web server

Each token will be a 16 character hex string.

Make sure that you supply each flag in the correct submission field.
