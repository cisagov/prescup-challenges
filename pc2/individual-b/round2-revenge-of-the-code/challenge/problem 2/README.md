Figure out what the correct input would need to be in order to produce the string found in [expected_output.txt](./expected_output.txt). 
Reverse the process that [reverse_functionality.exe](./reverse_functionality.exe) performs on a given string.

The proper syntax for using the program is:
```
reverse_functionality.exe yourinputstring
```
`yourinputstring` would be the string you want to test.
Test how certain strings behave or attempt to reverse engineer the executable.

The correct input used to obtain the string is your token for the problem.
