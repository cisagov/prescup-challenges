In this problem, you are tasked with rewriting a small function in order to make it more efficient. 
You are given two files, [main.rs](./optimize/src/main.rs) and [functions.rs](./optimize/src/functions.rs):

`main.rs` contains the tests that will be run on your code
`functions.rs` is where you will do your work

Fill in the `fibo_optimized()` function to calculate the n'th fibonacci number in a way that is 
more efficient (time-wise) than the given code in `fibo_slow()`.

Once you are satisfied with your implementation, run [grader.sh](../../grader.sh) in the top level folder. 

If your code produces the intended results in less than 100us (microseconds), 
you will receive at least one token for submission when the grading script is run. 

If your code produces the expected results in less than 25us, 
you will receive two tokens for submission amounting to full credit for this problem.
