# More Than Meets the Eye - Revenge of the Code
Players will be required to analyze, write, optimize, or correct pieces of code or executables in order to retrieve various tokens.

**NICE Work Role:** 

- [Software Developer](https://niccs.cisa.gov/workforce-development/nice-framework)

**NICE Tasks:**

- [T0046](https://niccs.cisa.gov/workforce-development/nice-framework) - Correct errors by making appropriate changes and rechecking the program to ensure that desired results are produced.
- [T0111](https://niccs.cisa.gov/workforce-development/nice-framework) - Identify basic common coding flaws at a high level.
- [T0436](https://niccs.cisa.gov/workforce-development/nice-framework) - Conduct trial runs of programs and software applications to ensure that the desired information is produced and instructions and security levels are correct.
- [T0553](https://niccs.cisa.gov/workforce-development/nice-framework) to reduce exploitation opportunities.

## Background
You have been given four programming related problems to solve. Each problem will provide you with one or more tokens for submission towards the overall completion of this challenge. Problems will require you to analyze code as well as ask you to write your own code to efficiently complete the required tasks.

## Getting Started
Additional information on challenge parts 2 through 4 can be found within their respective problem folders within the [challenge folder](./challenge/README.md). Rust and Cargo functions on debian systems can be run from `/root/.cargo/bin/` with the sudo command--e.g. `sudo /root/.cargo/bin/rustc myrustfile.rs`.

## Completion Conditions
In order to complete this challenge, all four problems must be solved as expected, and problem 4 has two levels of completion, which makes for five tokens overall. A [grading script](grader.sh) for problems 3 and 4 can be found in this top level folder. Run this script using `./grader.sh` a terminal window once you've completed both problems 3 and 4. 

## Answer Format
Each token found within this challenge consists of a 12-character string made up of lowercase letters and numbers. The lowercase l and the number 1 have been removed to eliminate any confusion between the two.

All 5 parts will follow the same token format. 

## Hints
Even though you are looking at code, the solution to a problem does not always require writing new code.
